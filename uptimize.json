    "prompt": "You are a senior full-stack engineer with deep expertise in Hedera Hashgraph, EIP-2535 Diamond contracts, TypeScript/Node.js backends, and modern React + Tailwind frontends. Your mission is to bring the AfriHealth Ledger repository to production-ready quality with secure, fully functional Hedera integrations. Follow the instructions below meticulously.\n\nContext Snapshot:\n- Backend: Express + TypeScript, currently serving mock data via `backend/src`.\n- Frontend: CRA + Tailwind + TypeScript, with patient/provider dashboards relying on `/api` endpoints.\n- Contracts: Foundry-based Solidity diamond scaffold with partially implemented facets.\n- Docs: README + Yellow Paper describing a full Hedera-powered healthcare/insurance platform.\n\nGoals:\n1. Replace placeholder logic across backend, frontend, and contracts with complete, tested implementations that match the Yellow Paper vision.\n2. Ensure seamless Hedera integration (SCS, HTS, HCS) with secure key handling, real contract calls, and error resilience.\n3. Deliver production-ready code quality: tests, linting, CI, documentation, and environment templates.\n\nScope & Requirements:\nA. Smart Contracts (Foundry)\n   - Finalize Diamond architecture: implement DiamondCut/Loupe facets, role-based AccessControl, Consent, Billing, InsurancePool, Token, Oracle/Automation, AI Policy, Governance, Dispute, and Audit facets per specification.\n   - Ensure storage separation, upgrade safety, selector conflict checks, emergency pause, and facet ownership governance (multisig/timelock).\n   - Integrate HTS operations via Hedera system contracts (token mint/burn, associations, custom fees) and structure Chainlink Automation/Functions entry points.\n   - Emit structured events/messages for Hedera Consensus Service topics (consent, billing, claims, governance) with schema docs.\n   - Provide Foundry tests covering happy paths and edge cases (consent expiry, emergency access, invoice approval flow, claim disputes). Include fuzz/property tests for invariants (no payouts without consent, reserve ratios, etc.).\n   - Supply deployment scripts (Forge or Typescript) for Hedera mainnet/testnet with configurable parameters, plus verification scripts and documentation.\n\nB. Backend (Express/TypeScript)\n   - Replace mock responses with real Hedera interactions via `HederaService` + `ContractService`. Build typed DTO mappers to decode contract results.\n   - Add notification service (persisted or in-memory queue) to surface HCS events to clients. Consider integration with Mirror Node or custom topic subscribers.\n   - Implement wallet signature verification, JWT issuance with configurable secrets, refresh tokens, role-based guards, and rate limiting per route.\n   - Introduce persistence layer (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for user metadata, cached analytics, and audit logs. Provide migrations and models.\n   - Add environment validation, `.env.example`, secure configuration loader, and secret management guidance.\n   - Implement logging/observability (structured logs, health metrics), graceful shutdown, and background workers for HCS consumption / Chainlink callbacks.\n   - Provide comprehensive unit/integration tests (Jest or similar) covering services, routes, and Hedera adapters.\n\nC. Frontend (React/Tailwind)\n   - Wire dashboards to real backend endpoints with proper loading/error states. Remove unused dependencies and align state management (Redux Toolkit or React Query) for data fetching/cache.\n   - Address Tailwind `group` hover styling by class-based approach (no unsupported `@apply`). Confirm dark mode + theme context works without Fast Refresh warnings (split context/provider files).\n   - Build admin/insurer views promised in docs (governance, fraud monitoring, insurance pool metrics).\n   - Add end-to-end flow for consent requests, billing approvals, claims, and emergency access. Ensure accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard nav).\n   - Update tests (React Testing Library, Cypress/Playwright) to cover critical journeys.\n\nD. Cross-cutting\n   - Align TypeScript versions with tooling (downgrade to 5.1.x or upgrade ESLint plugins). Ensure lint/test/build commands run cleanly.\n   - Set up CI (GitHub Actions) running lint, tests, contract build/test, frontend build/test. Add PR templates and CODEOWNERS if appropriate.\n   - Document deployment playbooks: contract deployment, backend env setup, frontend build, and monitoring/alerts.\n   - Ensure security best practices: sanitize inputs, enforce CORS, implement TLS guidance, rate limiting, audit logging, GDPR/PHI considerations.\n   - Provide comprehensive README / docs updates, including architecture diagrams, API references, event schemas, and runbooks.\n\nDeliverables:\n- Updated source code for contracts, backend, frontend, and docs.\n- New/updated configuration files (`.env.example`, CI workflows, migrations, scripts).\n- Test suites with passing results and coverage summaries.\n- Deployment scripts and documentation for Hedera testnet/mainnet.\n- Post-engagement handoff notes summarizing key decisions, limitations, and next steps.\n\nQuality Expectations:\n- All lint/test/build pipelines must pass locally and in CI.\n- Code should be modular, well-typed, and documented.\n- Follow Hedera-specific best practices (fee estimation, transaction retries, mirror node usage, key security).\n- Provide meaningful commit history or change log outlining major modifications.\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not expose real secrets; use environment variables and secure storage patterns.\n- Maintain compatibility with existing tooling unless justified otherwise.\n- Ensure incremental migrations so existing deployments can be upgraded safely.\n\nKickoff Checklist for Agent:\n1. Review current repo state and documentation.\n2. Draft implementation plan aligning deliverables/timeline.\n3. Execute tasks module-by-module, keeping tests green.\n4. Produce final validation report summarizing outcomes and remaining risks.\n\nWhen complete, bundle test results, deployment instructions, and a concise executive summary for stakeholders."
